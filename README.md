## Introduction

After playing the Psych! Outwit your friends and knowing Cards against Humanity, I was wondering what other easy-to-start games to play with friends and family are out there.

I try to update and review the games as I can, my aim is to have a handful of games that are usable by remote family and friends of any age, which is easier said than done. Ideally these would be browser-based games so that they work on any device.

Any contributions are welcome.
